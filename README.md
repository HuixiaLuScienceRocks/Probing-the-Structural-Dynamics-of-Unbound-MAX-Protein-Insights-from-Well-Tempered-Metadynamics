# Probing-the-Structural-Dynamics-of-Unbound-MAX-Protein-Insights-from-Well-Tempered-Metadynamics

In this repository, we provide essential files for conducting well-tempered metadynamics simulations to help explore the conformational space of the unbounded MAX protein. 

## If you find these instructions useful, I am more than happy to share. When you use any of these files, please cite my paper. Thank you.
These files are for a manuscript in preparation, but I will submit soon:

# highlights from this work:

Our results revealed, for the first time, a well-defined and thermodynamically favorable conformation of MAX in its monomeric, unbound form. This is a notable finding, as it demonstrates that regions of MAX, previously thought to be persistently disordered, can adopt stable, folded structures under appropriate conditions. These findings also suggest the existence of transient but persistent structural motifs that may harbor druggable sites, especially in contexts where targeting MAX directly or disrupting its interactions with MYC could modulate oncogenic signaling pathways.
This study provides a new structural framework for understanding the dynamics of MAX and lays the foundation for future structure-based drug design targeting the MYC/MAX axis. Our work offers a roadmap for similar investigations of other challenging drug targets.
