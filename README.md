# Probing-the-Structural-Dynamics-of-Unbound-MAX-Protein-Insights-from-Well-Tempered-Metadynamics

In this repository we are providing essential files for conduting well-tempered metadynamics simulations to help explore the conformational space of unbounded MAX protein. 

Related results are provided in folder "Results-PCA", convergence, etc.

## Simulating packages used in this work:

1. Classical MD: amber/24-gcc-ompi-plumed2.9
2. well-tempered metaD: gromacs/2023.5_plumed-2.9.2-gcc-nvhpcx

## If you find these instruction usedful I am more than happy to share. When you use my files, please cite my paper. Thanks.
These files are for manuscript in preparation:
